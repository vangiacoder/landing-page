description: |
---
  When I was studying at Hanoi University of Industry, I did a topic in open source. That is to learn about spring framework and create a [commercial website](https://github.com/vegetaz/onelineshopping) based on Spring.
  This website I use Spring mainly, still apply RESTful API, JWT, Spring Security, ... For the front-end I use a Boostrap template available on the internet.
