  When I was studying at Hanoi University of Industry, <br/>my research topic was "open source". I found Spring framework quite interesting so I studied it and built <br/>an [e-commerce website](https://github.com/vegetaz/onelineshopping) with Spring. On that website, I use Bootstrap template for front-end and mainly Spring for back-end. Other applied technologies are RESTful API, JWT, Spring Security, MySQL, etc.
